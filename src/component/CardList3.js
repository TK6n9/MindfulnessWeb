              we want everyone to have the outside space their home deserves.
              Our professionally designed planting collections are tailored to
              your garden conditions. Soto also provides a curated selection of
              plants and accessories at Garden Centre prices, alongside advice
              and inspiration.

              Soto delivers the ingredients for a stylish outside space, but we
              donâ€™t do the planting. We provide the inspiration, plants, and
              guidance but we leave the final step to you. Think of us as a meal
              box delivery service or an interior look book. We show you what
              you could achieve with your outside space and, most significantly,
              how to put it together.

              contains a jargon- buster and further reading for those wanting to
